hello. I like to create things in java that pique my interest. (such as small games or something barely involving math ðŸ˜‚) <br/>
I don't think I know the ins and outs of java or that I know some basic things in it, I just convert my ideas using java and outside resources. (no copy pasting)
i am currently learning java as well as beginning to learn c++ cause it looks fun

# projects
- tetris
- game of life
- logic sim
