Hello! I like to create things in java that pique my interest. (such as small games or something involving math) <br/>
I don't think I know the ins and outs of java or that I know some basic things in it, I just convert my ideas using java and outside resources.
I am currently learning java as well as some python.

# projects
- simulations based on physics
- drawing applications
- random bs

my next biggest project will probably be a simple neural network because machine learning is a really interesting topic
